Well Done C.A. Sahab!—the first Hindi feature ever made on the subject of Chartered Accountancy—marks a significant milestone in my career. The film has already made waves on the festival circuit: it was nominated at the Jaipur International Film Festival 2025, selected for the 15th Dada Saheb Phalke Film Festival, and earned me the Best Debut Filmmaker award at the Golden Lion International Film Festival 2025. Theatrical release is on the horizon, and I'm excited for audiences to experience it soon.",

                  Never Ending Films is a young, one-year-old production house driven by a vibrant mix of seasoned industry professionals and emerging creative minds from the visual media space. With a shared passion for storytelling and a love for cinema, we aim to craft content that not only entertains but also shifts perspectives.

                  Our philosophy is simple: there's no creative problem that can't be solved over countless cups of chai and coffee. Our cabin-less, designation-less, and office-less office thrives on collaboration—where professionals and unprofessionals huddle together to brainstorm 'useless' ideas that eventually transform into compelling stories.

                  In just one year, NE Films has produced a range of content including commercials, music videos, a documentary, and is currently working on two upcoming feature films and a web series. Of course, we've also made our fair share of mistakes—but each one has been a stepping stone in our journey.
